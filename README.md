<center> <h1>HBNB - The Console</h1> </center>

This repository contains the initial stage of a student project to build a clone of the AirBnB website. This stage implements a backend interface, or console, to manage program data. Console commands allow the user to create, update, and destroy objects, as well as manage file storage. Using a system of JSON serialization/deserialization, storage is persistent between sessions.

## Project Description

This project is a simplified Airbnb clone with a console interface implemented in Python. It allows users to interact with the system using various commands to manage properties, users, and bookings.

## Database Implementation
The Airbnb Clone now uses a MySQL database, leveraging Python's SQLAlchemy and the SQLAlchemy ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for seamless interaction with the database. The storage engine is designed to manage data persistence and retrieval.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is built using the Python cmd module, providing a user-friendly interface to perform various operations within the Airbnb clone. Users can input commands to create and manage users, amenities, and more.

## How to start
To start the Airbnb Clone Console Interface, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eyzee00/AirBnB_clone.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
      cd AirBnb_clone
    ```
3. Run the command interpreter:
   ```bash
      python3 console.py
   ```
## How to use
Once the command interpreter is running, you can enter commands to perform various actions. The general syntax for commands is as follows:
   ```python
    (hbnb)command_name [arg1] [arg2] ... [argN]
   ```
## Examples
1. show all users:

   ```bash
   (hbnb)all User
   ```
2. create  a user
   ```
   (hbnb)create User
    ```
      this creates a default user and return it's ID
3. the help command to find all command
   ```bash
    (hbhb)help
   ```
